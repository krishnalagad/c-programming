                                ****** NOTES *****

1) defaulted & deleted member functions
    : you can explicitly specify what is enabled vs disabled

2) constructor delegation
    : transfer control from one constructor another of the same class to use "chaining of constructors" to fully construct an object. It can avoid duplicated initialization code.

3) explicit keyword
    : prevents a constructor with 1 "unknown/non-default" parameter to be used for an implicit type conversion.

4) Introduction to smart pointers
    : scope based resource management for handling pointer deallocation "smartly".

5) using keyword
    : creates an alternate name/alias for some type.

6) auto keyword
    : allows for inferring or deducing type of a variable based on initial value.

7) uniform initialization
    : one common syntactical way of initializing everything.

8) nullptr
    : replacement of NULL macro with a proper type (std::nullptr_t)

lvalues: values that are in the RAM (have a fixed location) aka have an adress

rvalues: temporary value (result of an expression or displacement).
          rvalues dont have a fixed address (We cant go to their location in RAM and find value )
